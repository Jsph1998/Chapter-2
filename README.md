# Chapter-2
In this chapter, i learned how to create my first app and use hot reload to view changes instanta-neously. I also saw how to use themes to style apps, when to use stateless and stateful widgets, and how to add external packages to save myself from reinventing the wheel. I now have a general 
understanding of the main ideas behind Flutter app development.

I use Visual Studio Code for the Hello World.![IMG_20241211_184413](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a804c7a-93cc-44ab-a1c3-f2fc7f401c21)
